ðŸŒ¸ Iris Flower Classification using Machine Learning
This project is part of my Data Science Internship at CodeAlpha, where I worked on building a supervised machine learning model to classify iris flowers based on their physical characteristics.

ðŸ“˜ Project Overview
The Iris dataset is one of the most famous datasets used in machine learning. It contains 150 samples from three species of iris flowers (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica), with four features each:

Sepal Length

Sepal Width

Petal Length

Petal Width

The task is to predict the species of an iris flower based on these features using a classification algorithm.

ðŸ›  Tools and Technologies
Language: Python

IDE: Visual Studio Code (VS Code)

Libraries:

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib

Seaborn

Scikit-learn

ðŸ“ˆ Workflow
Data Loading and Exploration
Used pandas to load the dataset and explore its structure.

Data Visualization
Created scatter plots and pairplots using matplotlib and seaborn to understand relationships between features.

Data Preprocessing
Split the data into training and testing sets using train_test_split.

Model Building
Trained classification models such as:

Logistic Regression

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Model Evaluation
Evaluated the model using:

Accuracy Score

Classification Report

Confusion Matrix

ðŸ§  Key Learnings
Understood how classification models work

Learned how to preprocess, visualize, and analyze structured data

Gained confidence in writing and executing ML code in VS Code

Practiced evaluating model performance with real metrics
